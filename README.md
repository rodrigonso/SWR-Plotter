# SWR-Plotter
Python script that plots the Standing Wave Ratio (SWR) vs Frequency with certain parameters. This plot is used to determine the bandwidth of operation for transmission lines in the frequency domain where the SWR is closer to 1 (No reflections) -- which is ideal for the applications in this class.
